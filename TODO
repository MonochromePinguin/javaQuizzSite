• entry-quizz servlet:
    in case of inscription MCQ :
	Cadd logic to decide if the user can go to the next step, « account creation and inscription ».
_ add account creation/inscription page
_ add logging page

• all-quizz servlet:
    _ when the user is logged as teacher, show info fields :

        _ add also a « last Modified Date » in the Quizz object
    _ when user logged in as student :
        last Modified date
    _ add sort criterias, at least Quizz name/ creation date / creator in the JSP, first through HTML then JS

• ordering of questions:
    in inter_question_quizz, add question's weight for ordering

• add home / quizz ordered by theme /theme list / etc. buttons on the nav-bar

• Quizz object:
    _ add « public boolean hasError;   //an error flag set to 1 if a question of the quizz lacks reponse or, if the quizz
         is randomly build, the needed question quantity is not met »
      → quizz is shown with an error message and greyed ;
      → the quizz page is innacessible
        → validateQuizz() function testing coherency : Qty of questions, presence of answers
    _ add also a lastEdited field that will also be edited.

• quizz servlet: 2 booleans → 4 combinations:
	isMCQ:                pure MCQ /allow free-text answers 
    isRandom/nbQuestions: determined quizz / randomly-generated quizz with 𝑛 questions
_ add test display of free-text questions

        for a small, property-configurable validity time
_ add password reset page and logic (reset links, time-limited validity, ...)
_ add « contact Us / leave a message » page
_ admin pages:
    list/remove/renames/add/modify quizzes

• header/a13y : buttons for changing font-size.
    without JS : links to /font-size-${current-font-size}-bigger/${currentURL}
                    and /font-size-${current-font-size}-smaller/${currentURL},
    handled by a servlet which also handle creation of a custom «font-size.css »
    included before « main.css » in each page :
        html {
            font-size: <%= fontSize %>
        }
→ all sizes in main.css are in *rem* ...

• quizz list JSP:
    add SVG icons on warning messages and perhaps other places

• admin pages:
    retrieving leaved messages,
    adding/removing students, teachers

• security:
    _care about ${rawAboutText} and possible vulnerabilities

_ DB creation script: add triggers for MySQL
    (to replace the dummy « check() » statements)
_ db creation script: write a function to use in the check (and the trigger)
    of « answers » table: it will verify that question(questionId).isQCM == true

_ write DB filling script – realistic data
_ write the README.md and its simple howto for ubuntu
_ write use-cases
_ DB creation script: add checks for several relations :
	_ there must exists at least two responses to each MCQ question,
    _ when the quizz is randomly built, there must exists at least  "nbQuestions" questions of same theme as the quizz else the deletion of any of these questions will fail
_ DB : test the "on delete" constraint
